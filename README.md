## Description

- "Guess My Number"  is a simple game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 20, and the player has to guess the number. The game should display a message asking the player to guess a number between 1 and 20.

- The player enters their guess in an input field and submits it. The game checks the guess against the computer's number and displays a message indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

- If the guess was too high, the game displays a message saying "Too high, try again". If the guess was too low, the game will display a message saying "Too low, try again". If the guess was correct, the game displays a message saying "Congratulations, you guessed the number!".

- The game also keeps track of the number of guesses the player has made and display this information after each guess. Additionally, the game has an option to start a new game after the player has either won or given up.
